# datautils
some python data utilities I wrote

The utilities are scripts that handle a variety of singular functions.  Like reading a csv and converting it to a python dictionary, or inserting it into a sqlite3 database in memory.  The intent was to teach students how to parse various files and create a data structure in python, then output into another format.  There is some semblence of a standard, but, this was meant as a demo for teaching and not a utility for commercial use.
